The system of country has changed.
Countries has been split in countries and states.

The migration process is tricky and couldn't be automated.

The update proccess has created new countries (even if it exists) and associated states.
A module (**TheliaMigrateCountry**) has been created to help you to migrate between the 2 systems.

If you want to use states/provinces please activate the module **TheliaMigrateCountry** in your backoffice,
and go to the *migrate country* page to execute the migration process.
